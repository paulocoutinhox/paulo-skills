# Sources and interpretation limits

Verified: **2026-11-09**. Scope: a descriptive English workflow for Remotion/React video production
on local hosts, Node rendering, Player and optional AWS Lambda. Public Remotion documentation
inspected for this revision showed a **v4.0.541** baseline in installation examples, with some APIs
documenting future v5 behavior. Check the installed version for operational work. This date does
not guarantee continued availability or authorize automatic updates.

## Requested source and adaptation

Paulo Coutinho's [complete Remotion guide](https://paulox.dev/blog/2026/7/3/remotion-skills-crie-videos-animados-com-ia-do-prompt-a-renderizacao-o-guia-completo/),
published 2026-07-03, is the user-requested source. Its conceptual, production and troubleshooting
sections and embedded generator examples were inspected. This package reorganizes their knowledge
into an actionable English procedure with focused references. It does not redistribute the article's
Python programs or treat their provider constants as universal API contracts.

## Conflicts and recommendations

- The article's scene ranges sometimes precede adding transitions. Explicit overlap arithmetic in
  this package prevents shortening a requested 15-second export or creating a blank tail.
- The local Whisper example uses `medium.en` alongside Portuguese narration. Use a multilingual
  model for Portuguese. The blog's fixed Whisper version, voice IDs and model defaults are examples,
  not current-account or all-version guarantees.
- Current Remotion pages recommend timing directly on supported elements/media and mark some
  older patterns as legacy. Retain explicit Sequence semantics for compatible projects, but inspect
  the installed API before applying new timing/media examples. Do not mix `durationInFrames` source
  trimming with parent placement, especially with playback-rate changes.
- GSAP requires a Remotion-owned clock. The researched vendor adapter supports this and replaces
  the need to invent a custom timeline loop on compatible versions.
- A linear amplitude value is not a loudness target. The article's stem targets and separation are
  mix examples, not a universal delivery standard or proof of measured final loudness.
- Exact safe-area pixels, fixed cover crops, frame-zero thumbnail behavior and distribution/retention
  thresholds are not universal platform rules. Treat them as design hypotheses requiring placement
  inspection, rather than repeating unsupported algorithmic guarantees.
- Restrained glow, strong copy, SVG icons, brand consistency and a clear CTA are creative direction.
  They do not prohibit intentional flat design, emoji, linear motion or a typographic scene.
- “Free,” “royalty-free” and an available platform soundtrack do not settle every asset's rights.
  This revision did not inspect every listed stock catalog's terms or any user's account eligibility.
  Resolve those for the actual production asset. No generic commercial-use clearance is claimed.

## Professional foundations and access limits

The guide names Richard Williams's *The Animator's Survival Kit* and Frank Thomas/Ollie Johnston's
*The Illusion of Life*. Timing, spacing, anticipation, staging and secondary action provide useful
motion vocabulary. The [Disney publisher page](https://books.disney.com/book/the-illusion-of-life/)
was inspected for bibliographic verification. The Animator's Survival Kit site timed out. Neither
full book was accessed for this revision, so both remain further reading rather than fully consulted
texts or additional Remotion requirements.

The guide also names Schwartz, Miller, Ogilvy, Hormozi, Sugarman, Wiebe and Handley as copywriting lenses. Their
books were not accessed in full and their summarized ideas are identified as creative heuristics.
[Cialdini's primary overview](https://www.influenceatwork.com/7-principles-of-persuasion/) was inspected
for the persuasion concepts. It does not establish a conversion prediction for these video recipes.

The attempted separate ElevenLabs voice-settings page redirected to sign-in. The public speech
best-practices page was available. Account-specific voice availability, every model's exact control
range, provider image-size constraints and account-specific commercial permissions remain live
operational checks, not stored universal facts.

This revision is a documentation adaptation and source review. No video generation, TTS request,
transcription, Remotion render, AWS deployment, cloud job, store upload or publication was performed
to establish these instructions. Mechanical package validation and manual scenario review are
separate from executing those domain operations. The package's [license](../LICENSE.md) covers its
authored content and does not replace third-party licenses or paid service terms.
